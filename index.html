         Library, traditionally, collection of books used for reading or studying, or the building or room in which such a collection is kept.<br>
         The word derives from the Latin liber, “book,” whereas a Latinized Greek word, bibliotheca, is the origin of the word for library<br>
         in German, Russian, and the Romance languages. The very earliest libraries are believed to have been built around five thousand<br>
         years ago, with the first human efforts to organize collections of documents. These took the form of clay tablets in cuneiform<br>
         script about an inch thick, in various shapes and sizes.
         <br>
         <br>
         The history of libraries in what is now the United Arab Emirates (UAE) datesback over 100 years to the founding of the Taymiyah <br>
         Library in Sharjah in 1907. During the years before the establishment of the UAE, many other private libraries were established <br>
         in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Ras al Khaimah. The first true public library was established in Dubai in 1965. The first public <br>
         libraries established at the federal level were those set up by the Ministry of Information and Culture in 1972 in many locations <br>
         throughout the UAE. Some of the oil companies set up libraries as well.
         <br>
         <br>
         Now The UAE is home to around 200 libraries across the seven emirates and takes pride in having a variety of libraries across the <br>
         country and can be divided into three categories in terms of their affiliation: 
         <br>
         <br>
         &#8226; Libraries that belong to federal entities, such as public libraries of the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Community Development <br>
        (MCYCD), libraries set up by local entities such as the National Libraries in every Emirate and libraries owned by private clubs <br>
        and organisations.<br>
<br>
         &#8226; In addition, there are libraries that serve certain target groups, such as university and college libraries that primarily cater to the <br>
         educational and research needs of students and faculty members. <br>
<br>
         &#8226; All major universities in UAE boast large and state-of-the-art libraries with thousands of titles, reference books and specialised<br>
        database. <br>
